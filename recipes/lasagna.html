    <img src="../images/lasagna.jpg">
    <p>this is lasagna. one of my favorite dishes to eat.
        maybe not to make because it has it's complicated 
        steps to it but the final result always makes it worth
        it... The truth about it is that I have never made lasagna 
        in my life but I sure as hell enjoy eating it.
